This engine aims to implement everything without copying other engines.

## Todo
- Basic UCI protocol
- Board representation
- Fen parsing
- Move generation
- Make and undo moves with a custom undo type
- Perft function with divide for debugging
- Basic Negamax algorithm WITH LASY SMP from the start
- Extremely basic evaluation (just material or something)
- Alpha beta pruning
- Quiescence search
- Late Move Reductions
- Transposition Table
- Aspiration Windows
- NNUE

## Done
