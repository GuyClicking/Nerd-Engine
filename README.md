- Fen parsing

- Make and undo moves with a custom undo type
- Perft function with divide for debugging
- Basic Negamax algorithm WITH LASY SMP from the start
- Extremely basic evaluation (just material or something)
- Alpha beta pruning
- Quiescence search
- Late Move Reductions
- Transposition Table
